# Project-1-Memory-Game-


This game is a memory game that I created!

How you play: 

The point of this game is you want to be able to match a card with the same card on the other side of the field!

You want to click on one card and then after click on another card. 

If the cards match together they will stay on the field and you can flip another seet of cards. 

You win once all the cards on the field are flipped over!
